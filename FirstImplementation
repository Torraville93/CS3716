By Friday, November 21st:

Implement feature 1. Will read all students from a text file and put them into a user specified 
group size. The classes of GroupManager and Group will be implemented, and the students will
be placed into a Group object, in which GroupManager will have the relevant methods to change the
group according to the user's specifications.

From Professor:
- Strategy Pattern
- Describe use case
- Domain model diagram
- System does not know where students list comes from(text file, database..etc)
- Next week, if we need to add the ability to restrict groups, all we should have to do is add a class
  shouldn't have to make changes to existing classes.
