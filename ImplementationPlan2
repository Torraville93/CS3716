- Fix bug that does not print the last group.
- Add a GUI window to display generated groups.

- Implement Feature 6 "support adding queries by instructor, to get additional info from students
	(schedules, preferences, experience)"

- If time allows, begin implementing feature 7 "F7-support adding class 
and private time schedules by students"

-No scrollbar on generated group window

//NOTE: USER - interface for STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR
//INSTRUCTOR needs to use LIST of PARAMETERS
//each STUDENT needs to have a copy of said PARAMETER LIST
//need GETTERS & SETTERS too
//try to get GUI working with DECENT generator strategy
//implement simple DECENT strategy 


(Perhaps have ParameterSpec as comparing methods, and GroupParameter be the EnumMap)
