- Fix bug that does not print the last group.
- Add a GUI window to display generated groups.

- Implement Feature 6 "support adding queries by instructor, to get additional info from students
	(schedules, preferences, experience)"

- If time allows, begin implementing feature 7 "F7-support adding class 
and private time schedules by students"

/* Esteban comment:
- From firstImplementation and ImplementationPlan2 I read that only Features 1, 6 and 7
  are being implemented. Is that right? What happened with features 2, 3, 4 and 5?
  Where not they more important than features 6 and 7?
